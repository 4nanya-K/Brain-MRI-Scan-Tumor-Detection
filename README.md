COGS 118B FA24 Final Project

Dataset:  
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection  

We have a dataset of ~3,000 MRI scans of patient brains. Each image is labeled as either a tumor or non-tumor. We want to see if it is possible to train a computer vision model to classify tumors for a patient's MRI scan.  

To do so, we will experiment with 3 methods:  
1. PCA Reconstruction Error Classification
2. Supervised Convolutional Neural Network
3. Masked Autoencoder Reconstruction Error Classification
